# @function max_clique(chosen, graph)
# Finds the maximum clique in a graph. This uses a highly unoptimized brute-force method. This only works if you are passing in the node with the largest number of connections.
# There are several steps:
#   1. Visit every node within the graph
#   2. Calculate: visited node's connections âˆ© chosen node's connections
#       a) These values are stored in a hash of arrays, indexed by the visited vertex's number
#   3. Sort the previously stored hash by largest number of mutual connections.
#   4. For each mutual connection, add it to the clique IFF it is a superset of the nodes within clique
#       a) Otherwise, you would wind up with nodes that are not mutually connected!
#
# This code currently rests on the assumption that the set with the largest intersection is the best to start making a clique with. This is not entirely the case, and I need to correct it...
#
# @param _graph
# A hash of arrays, keyed by vertex number. EG:
#   "1" => [0,1,3]
# The above would represent vert 1 and its connections to verts 0, 1 and 3.

# @param chosen
# The vertex number(int) of the selected vertex
