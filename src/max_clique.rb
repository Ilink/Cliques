# @function max_clique(chosen, graph)
# Finds the maximum clique in a graph. This uses a highly unoptimized brute-force method. This only works if you are passing in the node with the largest number of connections.
# There are several steps:
#   1. Visit every node within the graph
#   2. Calculate: visited node's connections âˆ© chosen node's connections
#       a) These values are stored in a hash of arrays, indexed by the visited vertex's number
#   3. Sort the previously stored hash by largest number of mutual connections.
#   4. For each mutual connection, add it to the clique IFF it is a superset of the nodes within clique
#       a) Otherwise, you would wind up with nodes that are not mutually connected!
#
# @param graph
# A hash of arrays, keyed by vertex number. EG:
#   "1" => [0,1,3]
# The above would represent vert 1 and its connections to verts 0, 1 and 3.
#
# @param chosen
# The vertex number(int) of the selected vertex

# @function all_max_cliques(graph)
# First, we sort the graph. The first node, should therefore have the most number of connections.
# The basic idea here is:
#   1. Find maximum clique in graph
#   2. Remove that clique's verts from the graph
#   3. Repeat until all verts have been removed
#
# This idea rests on the assumption that having a lot of connections means greater potential for a large clique. I'm not entirely sure if this is correct!
# TODO: implement sorting, so we start with the clique with the most number of connections. Right now, the test input is already sorted like this, so it doesn't matter for testing
